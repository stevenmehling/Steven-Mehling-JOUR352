                    <p>In his career as an artist, Chuck Christian specialized in murals painted in the French style trompe l'oeil, literally translated as "deceive the eye." A shelf of books, a child's teddy bear, a window looking out at the ocean. They look real at first glance, until a closer inspection reveals Christian's delicate brushstrokes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Christian's artistic streak earned him some locker-room teasing from his teammates at Michigan, where he played tight end for Bo Schembechler's Wolverines from 1977 to 1981. If Christian missed a block in practice, he could expect to hear Schembechler's bark: "Someone find Christian a brush and let him paint!" The teasing was worth it, though. Christian's family was so poor that, when he needed groceries in college, his mother would shop with food stamps and deliver the bags to his door so his friends wouldn't find out. Without a football scholarship, there's no way he could have paid his way through art school.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After college, Christian started his own business, Chuck Christian Designs, and did custom artwork for clients near his home in the Boston area. Along with his murals, Christian has a selection of portraits, including one of Schembechler in mid-rant, headset yanked away from his mouth as he shouts into the facemask of quarterback Jim Harbaugh. He'd like to do more, but lately he's found he doesn't have the stamina.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Christian suffers from advanced prostate cancer and can't tolerate the pain of sitting for long periods. On a good day, he can move around the house on his own. On a bad day, his wife lifts him from his bed, places him on the toilet and carries his 6-foot-4 frame back again. So for now, the paintings will have to wait.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"I've got all these wonderful ideas in my head," Christian said. "I can't put them on canvas or on paper yet."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Christian was diagnosed three years ago, the cancer had already spread. It's possible his cancer could have been detected sooner, but Christian had an aversion to prostate exams that he traces to his experiences with Robert Anderson, the team doctor accused of abusing scores of Michigan athletes over more than four decades before his death in 2008.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Christian braced for an onslaught of anger when he decided to come forward with his experiences nearly six months ago. His son volunteered to scrub him from the internet if the vitriol became too intense, but the response was just the opposite. Christian received overwhelming support, along with many messages from ex-players sharing their own stories of abuse.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As allegations against Anderson grew into the hundreds, players expressed a range of emotions: disbelief, confusion, anger, a loss of faith in the institution that molded them into Michigan Men. Now, as the university enters mediation with Anderson's survivors and braces for the findings of an investigation conducted by the law firm WilmerHale, players are left with gnawing questions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why was Anderson allowed to prey on athletes for so long, even after credible allegations were raised on more than one occasion? What did he do to earn the protection of so many powerful figures at the university - including, apparently, the football coach idolized by so many of Anderson's victims? Players have their theories, some of which may be unprovable. But at least among some, there is a common suspicion that the full story has yet to be revealed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"Even when Bo had the power to get rid of him, he still didn't do it," Christian said. "That brings up other questions. Why didn't he do it? What's going on? Is there another layer to this whole thing that we don't even know about?"</p>

                <div class="col-md-8" id="Jon">
                    <p>Jon Vaughn is asking the same questions.</p>

                    <p>Vaughn arrived at Michigan in 1988 as an undersized running back from Florissant, Mo., and led the Wolverines in rushing two years later. Schembechler called him "Pissant" because of his diminutive frame, but Vaughn soon proved his worth. As a redshirt sophomore, he ran for 288 yards against UCLA and became the first Michigan player to top 200 rushing yards in consecutive games before declaring for the NFL Draft and leaving Ann Arbor behind.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In three years at Michigan, Vaughn says he was abused by Anderson on 12 occasions, beginning with his initial physical. During that physical and in subsequent visits, Vaughn says Anderson fondled his genitals and inserted fingers in his rectum. Though he found Anderson's behavior unsettling, Vaughn said he didn't realize he'd been raped until reports surfaced earlier this year outlining a pattern of abuse that spanned decades.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Vaughn, 50, now wants answers about why Anderson's abuse was allowed to continue for years after the first complaints were made. He said he's spoken to many ex-players who were abused by Anderson, a large number of whom have not identified themselves publicly. In their accounts, certain patterns appear over and over again, offering clues as to how Anderson gained access to his victims and insulated himself from serious scrutiny.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Vaughn exemplifies that pattern. Growing up near St. Louis, he was exposed to violence at an early age. His mother was a steadying influence, but Vaughn had a difficult relationship with his father, a volatile man who worked for a time as a collector for the Detroit Black Mafia.</p>
                    <br>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Even when Bo had the power to get rid of him, he still didn't do it," Christian said. "That brings up other questions. Why didn't he do it? What's going on? Is there another layer to this whole thing that we don't even know about?"
                    </blockquote>

                    <br>
                    <p>When Vaughn was young, he and his brother would spend their Saturdays hanging out at a bodega owned by their father's friend. Vaughn remembers playing checkers in the back one day when a car pulled up across the street. As the driver walked toward the bodega, Vaughn watched his father give a signal. Someone called the man's name, causing him to stop in the middle of the street. A car roared into view, flicking on its lights at the last moment as it sent the man sprawling over the hood.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Though he was only in kindergarten, Vaughn watched the man dying in the street and realized he'd witnessed a murder.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"I remember my father's friend said, 'Go ahead and get the boys home and I'll handle this,'" Vaughn said. "It was never something we mentioned or talked about."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Vaughn never saw his father hit his mother, but he recalls hearing the sounds of struggle from their bedroom. Once his mother came home with a gash on her head after jumping out of a moving car to escape Vaughn's father. So when the great Bo Schembechler promised him a scholarship, an education and a ticket out of a volatile home, Vaughn eagerly accepted.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"A father figure was something I was very much looking forward to, very interested in," Vaughn said. "My dad never taught me how to catch a ball. Everything I learned sports-wise was self-taught. Excelling in sports in high school, it was all just natural talent. You didn't have that figure to drive you in a direction or a path or get the most out of you. That's what I saw in the opportunity to be coached by Bo and his coaching staff."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Vaughn didn't know it then, but his decision to attend Michigan also brought him into contact with a serial sexual predator. Like many of Anderson's victims, Vaughn assumed the invasive examinations were the price of playing for such a storied program. Even if he'd wanted to complain, who was going to listen to a 5-foot-9 freshman - a pissant in his coach's lexicon?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"Bo was a legend," Vaughn said. "Everyone that you came in contact with associated with the football program, Bo picked. You had this trust/respect thing, because Bo wouldn't have had them around if he didn't trust and respect them."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Schembechler trusted Anderson enough to retain him as the team physician despite rumors and at least one alleged conversation about the doctor's behavior. A former student broadcaster, identified in court filings as John Doe EB-17, says he approached Schembechler in 1982 to report being digitally penetrated by Anderson. Schembechler directed the student broadcaster to report the incident to athletic director Don Canham, who by that time had received a complaint from a former Michigan wrestler making similar allegations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There's no evidence that Canham acted on the student broadcaster's complaint or that Schembechler took further action, either at the time or after he succeeded Canham as athletic director in 1988.</p>
                    <br>      
                    <p>If either man had acted then, Vaughn and other ex-players could have been spared the painful experiences that led them to realize, 30 years later, that they were survivors of sexual abuse. So why didn't it happen?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That question has been bothering Vaughn from the time these allegations surfaced. The full answer has yet to emerge, but a deeper look at Anderson's 35-year career reveals a few clues.</p>
